\chapter{Questions:}
Why do we have the following statements?
\begin{itemize}
    \item (pp. 99) ``allowing negative position in firm equity makes small firms change the asset span''
    \item In equilibirum, denote the equilibrium input as ${k^h}^*$, then $Q^h({k^h}^*) = D^h({k^h}^*)$.
    In words, prices are the same in equilibrium for both RC and Dreze.
\end{itemize}
