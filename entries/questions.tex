\chapter{Questions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Are the following true?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item With bid-ask spread (i.e., transaction costs), $q \leq \pi A \leq q + \gamma$?
        where $q = \pi A$ if $\gamma = 0$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Why do we have the following statements?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item (pp. 99) ``allowing negative position in firm equity makes small firms change the asset span''
        \item In equilibirum, denote the equilibrium input as ${k^h}^*$, then $Q^h({k^h}^*) = D^h({k^h}^*)$.
        In words, prices are the same in equilibrium for both RC and Dreze.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Confusions about the proofs:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item I don't see how Lemma 5.1 is used in the proof of Theorem 5.1.
    \end{itemize}
    \item How to define a competitive equilibrium with bonds and equity? 
    In particular, how to specify the Bond at time 0?
\end{itemize}
